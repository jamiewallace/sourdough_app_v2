      %h1 Frequently Asked Questions
      %h4 What is a sourdough starter?
      %p A sourdough starter is a yeast culture that you can use to make bread, in place of commercial fast-action yeasts.
      %h4 What does one look like?
      %p Something like this:

      %h4 Is it quite a hassle to look after?
      %p
      No. It just needs feeding with flour and water every so often.  If you bake bread a lot, it will need feeding frequently, but if you only bake bread once a week or less, you can just stick it in the fridge and forget about it until you need it again.
      %h4 But making sourdough bread is complicated, right?
      %p
      No again.  At least not once you've got the hang of it.  Check out this basic recipe.
      %h4 Do I need special equipment and ingredients?
      %p
      You need flour, water, salt, a big bowl, a baking tray and an oven.  A proving basket is optional.
      %h4 Does it take forever to make a loaf?
      %p End-to-end, yes, it takes quite a while, but for most of that time you can be doing something else (like going to work, writing a best-selling novel, going for a run, watching TV, sleeping, staring out the window...).
      %h4 OK, but why bother to make sourdough bread at home?
      %p Fair question.  Here are a few answers:
      %ul
        %li It's cheaper than buying it
        %li You know exactly what you're eating, as you made it.  Are you going to add ethoxylated mono and di glycerides?  Err, no.
        %li No need to buy yeast
        %li It's flexible - it'll work around you, rather than you having to work around it
        %li It tastes fantastic, and many people believe it's better for you than commercial breads (often made using the Chorley Wood process)
        %li It's very satisfying when you make a bloody good loaf (less so when it flops...)
        %li There's something nice and ritualistic about it
        %li It makes your home smell good
